                    Genetic correlation, RNAseq co-variation are helpful in
                    understanding the relationships among complex traits. The
                    observation of substantial genetic correlation across a pair
                    of traits or genes, can provide insights into shared genetic
                    pathways as well as providing a starting point to
                    investigate causal relationships. Attempts to estimate
                    genetic correlations among complex phenotypes have motivated
                    the analysis of large datasets as well as the development of
                    sophisticated machine learning algorithms. I propose and
                    discuss scalable Machine Learning algorithms to capture
                    genetic correlations for these two type of omics data: SNPs
                    and RNAseq. The method leverages the structure of data to
                    obtain runtimes that scale sub-linearly with the number of
                    individuals in the input dataset. I will also outline two
                    software named “DeepCrystal” and “BCrystal” which use deep
                    learning to identify proteins which can produce diffraction
                    quality crystals without the need to manually engineer
                    additional biochemical and structural features from
                    sequence. The two models are based on Convolutional Neural
                    Networks (CNNs), which can exploit frequently occurring
                    k-mers and sets of k-mers from the protein sequences to
                    distinguish proteins that will result in diffraction quality
                    crystals from those that will not.

                    Capital Market
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The Moroccan capital market is one of the largest and the
                    oldest in Africa. The major players in this market are: the
                    Casablanca Stock Exchange, the financial market authority
                    “AMMC”, the central depository “Maroclear“, brokerage firms,
                    asset management companies, banks and insurance and
                    reinsurance companies. The Casablanca Stock Exchange was
                    created in 1929. Its first goal was to meet the rising needs
                    for financial products and the globalisation of the Moroccan
                    economy. Since 2000 the Stock Exchange changes its name to
                    “Bourse de Casablanca SA” with a management board and
                    supervisory board. It was one of the key development of the
                    process of reform in the Moroccan capital market for better
                    regulation of various market activities and a consolidation
                    of the safety of investments. With the recent achievements
                    of Casablanca Finance City, confirms the status of Morocco
                    as a regional financial hub and as one of the most important
                    capital markets of Africa. In this research, we try to
                    understand the comportment of stock prices in Casablanca
                    stock exchange and to predict their values. Many studies
                    applied machine learning and deep learning models to stock
                    market prediction. However, in our knowledge, the majority
                    of those studies are not concerned by African capital
                    markets. This work closes this research gap; our goal is the
                    prediction of the movements (Up, Unchanged and Down) of the
                    stock market prices in the very short term (10 to 60 min
                    ahead). An experimental framework is proposed and a
                    selection machine learning and deep learning algorithms:
                    Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient
                    Boosted Trees (GBT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and
                    Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is tested within the proposed
                    framework. The comparison of these models is performed by
                    the analysis of the precision and recall metrics and the CPU
                    time of each model. The experimentations show promising
                    results for different classification setups.

                  <p>
                    Increases in the volume of data and the availability of
                    compute power have driven a number of advancements in the
                    field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and AI technologies
                    and applications are getting a flood of publicity in the
                    media. While four in five executives agree that AI is a
                    strategic opportunity for their organization, only about one
                    in five has incorporated AI in some offerings or processes,
                    and only one in 20 has extensively incorporated AI in their
                    offerings or processes. There is a gap between expectation
                    and action, and we are still in the early days of enterprise
                    AI adoption. This presentation explores the path our company
                    has taken to close this gap and to build an enterprise AI
                    capability, thereby realizing the full value of this
                    disruptive technology.
